//! The game's own option screen (「系统设置」/「オプション」).
//!
//! Everything on screen comes from the shipped layers, which are pixel
//! aligned with each other:
//!
//! ```text
//!   sys_03100/03101/03102   page base: grid, labels and silver widgets
//!   sys_03200/03210/03220   the same widgets in gold (a setting's current value)
//!   sys_03201/03211/03221   the same widgets in cyan (the widget under the cursor)
//!   sys_03000               top banner (1280x36)
//!   sys_03011               page tabs, 3 tabs x 3 states (192x32 each)
//!   sys_03040/03041/03042   one help line per setting row, 24 px each
//!   sys_03020               bottom bar: 3 arrow states plus the label strip
//!   sys_03030               "restore defaults" button, 3 states of 208x24
//! ```
//!
//! Widget rectangles are *not* taken from a table: they were recovered from
//! the images themselves (connected components of the widget border colour),
//! so no exe coordinates are needed. The Chinese patch ships its own copies of
//! 0310X / 0320X / 0321X / 0304X / 03020 / 03030, and `bg_dirs()` looks in the
//! CN directory first, so Chinese mode needs no extra work.
//!
//! Which overlay a widget gets is inferred: every widget is drawn from the
//! base layer, the option a setting currently holds comes from the gold layer,
//! and the widget under the cursor comes from the cyan layer.
